Additional Data Availability

Sequencing data from highthrough-put DNA sequencing experiments are deposited in Sequencing Read Archive (SRA) in the Bioproject ID PRJNA1000930 and are freely available from the following URL https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA1000930. 
AlienTrimmer 0.4.0 software (Criscuolo and Brisse, 2013) was used to trim adapter sequences and low-quality bases from raw Illumina reads. The software is freely available for download from the following URL https://bioweb.pasteur.fr/packages/pack@AlienTrimmer@0.4.0 The source code is also available upon request. 

FastQC software (Andrews, 2010) was used to evaluate the quality of the trimmed reads. The software is freely available for download from the following URL: https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/. The source code is also available upon request. 
CD-HIT-EST online server (Li and Godzik, 2006) was used to cluster the assembled transcripts. The server was freely available for use at the following URL https://sites.google.com/view/cd- hit/web-server. The on-line version is not available but the program can be run as a command line tool or a local CD-HIT server can also be downloaded from this URL: https://github.com/weizhongli/cdhit-web-server.
